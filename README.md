Website's Purpose: 

The website is made for gaming fans. On the first page the users can see the top 4 games for the 3 main categories that are: Recently Added, Top 4 Games for PC in 2021, Top 4 Games for Browser. Clicking on "Show More" button they can expand the list to see more games of each category. 

For each game the users can read the details about it and are able to see the Minimum System Requirements or any other additional information. Also it is possible to navigate to third party website if they click on "Play Now" button.

The navigation bar and the search tool appears on every website page to ease user experience.

On the second page (All Games) the users can see all games from each category. They can also filter the type of the games that they are looking for.

On the third page (Recently Added) the users can see the last 30 recently added games.

The website is made with React and it is for screens bigger than 1400px. The design of this website was not the first priority, that's why this website is not responsive. My purpose was to practise my React skills and to think more reactive. One of my goals was the dynamic url, that changes according to the filter changes. When the user sends the url to another user, the filtered result and the values of filtered dropdown list will remain exactly the same as the initial user's choice.
